# TUF-2000
TUF-2000 is an ultrasonic flowmeter. This project is a piece of software written in Java to fetch that information via url and convert the raw data to human readable values.

From the preview image you can see how the program looks. I've also implemented a popup when doubleclicking the unit box which tells you what the unit stands for e.g. GJ/h shows a popup saying "GJ/h: Giga Joule per hour (Giga = 10^9)".
